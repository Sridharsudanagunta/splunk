#### __gentimes__ <a name="gentimes"></a>
Generates timestamp results starting with the exact time specified as start time. Each result describes an adjacent, non-overlapping time range as indicated by the increment value. This terminates when enough results are generated to pass the endtime value.

All hourly time ranges from December 1 to December 5 in 2014
```| gentimes start=12/1/14 end=12/5/14 increment=1h```  

All daily time ranges from 30 days ago until 27 days ago.
```| gentimes start=-30 end=-27```

* gentimes is useful in conjunction with the map command.   
* It does not work for future dates.

#### __map__ <a name="map"></a>
